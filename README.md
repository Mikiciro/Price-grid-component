## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This exercise helped me a lot to practice with flexbox and page sizing. It was also useful for learning how to refactor code.

### Continued development

I will return to this exercise to practice CSS pseudo classes, so that I can improve the code.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41789278/first-child-full-width-in-flexbox) - I found this example solution with flexbox very useful for understanding how to set up the container and the other two containers
